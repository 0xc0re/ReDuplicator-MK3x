Wanhao i3 complete overhaul

This project is a complete overhaul of the original Wanhao i3 with a few main objectives:
- Keep the core components of the printer while upgrading its structure.  
- Create maximum rigidity through a sturdy 3030 Aluminium extrusion frame. 
- Allow for future proofing and commonality of parts by basing all printed parts on the current Prusa MK2s files. 
- Reduce the weight of the X and Y carriages where possible to improve print speed and quality.

The Wanhao i3 is a fabulous printer, but as a new generations of printers has arrived, it has become apparent that the wanhao has some deficiencies which can be corrected. The key improvements of this upgrade include:
- Muuch better rigidity through 3030 extrusions and metal brackets. Even with my or azzaâ€™s z braces the printer was still susceptible to slight wobble. Especially twisting (pull left tower and push right tower). When moving the printer it would always require releveling due these small movements. Now i can barely get any movement using full strength. 
- Comfortably increase Z height to ~210mm
- Reduce noise. By not screwing the motors directly onto the metal frame, motor vibrations and noise is reduced significantly. 
- Move towards more standard prusa files, but with added strength improvements.
- Modular hotend, This design allows for the hotend to be replaced easily by removing a few screws. I will be creating a Titan Aero mount and possibly a E3DV6 mount.
- Sturdier 4 bearing Prusa style X-gantry. Not sure if it was specific to my printer or a wanhao wide problem, but my X gantry always had a lot of wobble which may have been a source of printing artefacts.  
- Noticeably better print quality due to a combination of everything above. I am able to print faster with better quality.
