Total BOM is approx 100-150USD. However this is highly dependant on what you have laying around, where you source your parts from, what you want to carry over, and where in the world you are. A lot of my costs in Australia were shipping related.

I recommend Misumi for the core parts and will provide part numbers for each of those. For everything else cheap ebay / aliexpress parts will do. Many of the printed parts are designed around the Misumi bracket hole spacings. If you can’t source these parts (as misumi can be apain to order from if you are outside of the US), I have another thingiverse link filled with tabbed printed brackets. This definitely won't be as strong or sturdy as the proper metal braces however. 

Things you will need. 

- A Wanhao i3 Duh! (these parts will also allow you to upgrade most other prusa style printers, just adjust the lengths of your printer compared to the Wanhao’s smooth rods (X=320mm Z=320mm Y=380mm)

- Various 3030 T-slot Aluminium Extrusions
 - 2x 380MM - Tower X - HFSLB6-3030-380
 - 2x 355MM - Tower Z - HFSLB6-3030-355
 - 2x 350MM - Base Y - HFSLB6-3030-350
 - 2x 258MM - Base X - HFSLB6-3030-258

- 14x Corner Brackets 30x30x25 - Importantly these should be reversible and only be tabbed on one side! We are stacking two extrusions perpendicular on top of eachother. If they are tabbed on both sides they will NOT fit. HBLFSNB6

- 8x Aluminium Corner plates with 4 mounting holes. The legs and printed corner parts are all based on the misumi hole spacing HPTLS6.

- 4x LM8UU Bearings. These replace the stock Z bearings. It is also worthwhile purchasing some of the longer LM8LUU bearing to replace the X and Y axises if you are coming from a pre 2.1 wanhao. These misumi ones are much higher quality than the originals. LMU8, LMUW8.

- 70x M5 12mm Button head screws
- 10x M5 16mm Button head screws
- 2x M5 30mm Button Head screw (low profile)
- 20x M3 Heat-sert Brass http://au.element14.com/tr-fastenings/m3-uhbrhesf/brass-insert-unheaded-m3/dp/2474921
